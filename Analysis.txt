Task0
Time: 0(1)
- regardless of the number of elements in the dataset, the program is accessing the first and last
which is a simple lookup
Space: 0(1)
- nothing is being copied or duplicated in this solution


Task1
Time: O(n)
- the program will have to iterate through texts and calls once
- n being equal to the size of texts plus the size of calls
Space: O(1)
- nothing is being copied or duplicated in this solution


Task2
Time: O(n^2)
- when get_times_for_numbers is called, it will iterate through all of calls once
- for each element in the set is will check if it is in the callTimes keys
- the worst case being all the numbers are in the keys
Space: O(n)
- where n is the number of unique numbers in calls
- all the numbers in calls are being copied to a new data structure


Task3
Time: O(n)
- the main dataset, calls, is iterated once and two lists are created from this:
one containing all the phone codes Bangalore called and one for the unique codes.
Those lists are also iterated once. One could also argue that the answer is:
O(length of calls + length bangaloreCalled + length uniqueCodes)
Space: O(n)
- while the entire calls dataset isn't copied, some of it is used to create other lists
and 1/2n still comes out to n, all the new data structures are 1D


Task4
Time: O(n)
texts and calls are each iterated once and outgoing calls is also iterated
however there are no nested loops
Space: O(n)
new data structures are being made from the originals but they are all 1D
